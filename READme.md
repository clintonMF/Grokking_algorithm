# GR0KKING ALGORITHM CODES

AUTHOR - *** ADYTYA .Y BHARGAVA ***

## This repository
- This repository is for the codes in the book stated above.
- The codes are beginner algorithms and data structures. 
- This repository does not make up for the book. Although most of the algorithms
and Data structures in the repository are explained, beginners are advised to 
read the book first to get a better understanding of the concepts before coming 
to this repository. 


## Goal of this repository 
- This repository was created to help beginners understand the codes in 
the book. some of the data structures and algorithm spoken about in the book
were not given in code, This repository has codes for them. 
- It was also created to replicate the codes written in the book to other languages
such as **Golang**, **javascript** etc. For now the algorithms and data structures 
in the repository are only in python which is the language used in the book.
